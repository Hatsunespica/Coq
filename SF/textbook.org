** formal vs. informal proog
   + informal proofs are algorithms; formal proogs are code.
   + A proof of a mathematical proposition P is a written text that instills in the reader or hearer the certainty that P is true --  an unassailable argument for the truth of P. In another words, a proof is an act of communication.
     - One hand, those reader could be machines like "Coq" thus formal proofs generated.
